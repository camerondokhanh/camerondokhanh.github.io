                  <h2>The Shard Chair by Elias Hartmann</h2>
                  <p>Hartmann’s Shard Chair blurs the line between sculpture and function. Defined by sharp geometry and muted restraint, it reflects his process of moving between hand prototypes and digital modeling to create a design that challenges expectation while remaining unexpectedly comfortable.</p>

                  <h2>Marcel Breuer and the Cantilever Revolution</h2>
                  <p>Breuer’s use of tubular steel redefined what a chair could be. By removing the back legs, he introduced weightlessness and movement into modern interiors. This piece looks at how his cantilever designs challenged tradition and why they remain icons of modernist design.</p>
