            <h2>The Shard Chair by Elias Hartmann</h2>
            <p>Elias Hartmann has built a reputation for pushing industrial design into unfamiliar territory, and the Shard Chair is a clear example of that pursuit. The piece sits somewhere between sculpture and seating, defined by its faceted planes and unapologetic geometry. At first encounter, the chair feels less like a piece of furniture and more like an object cut from an architectural model. Its angular back and deliberate sharpness signal a refusal to blend in. Hartmann has long argued that a chair can be more than a utilitarian tool, and here he proves his case by creating an object that communicates identity before it even serves its function. The Shard Chair declares itself immediately as a presence within a room, carrying the weight of concept as strongly as the body it supports.</p>
            <p>The backrest, cut at sharp angles, deliberately rejects the idea of softness or compromise. Hartmann described it as “a break in the line of expectation,” a way to remind the sitter that a chair is never neutral. The fractured geometry is not an accident but a reflection of his interest in how discomfort and beauty can coexist. Its flat planes create a graphic silhouette, throwing sharp shadows that change with the light and giving the object a sculptural quality. Yet beneath this apparent austerity lies a careful attention to proportion: the recline is measured, the seat depth considered, the height calibrated to standard ergonomics. The paradox of the chair is that what looks severe is, in fact, unexpectedly forgiving to the body, offering comfort that belies its rigid outline.</p>

            <p>The choice of materials reflects Hartmann’s broader philosophy of precision and restraint. Powder-coated steel legs anchor the form with quiet authority, their weight providing stability while their profile remains slim and understated. The upholstered surfaces soften the structure, but not in a way that undermines its edge. Hartmann chose a muted green fabric, not for decorative effect, but for its ability to fade into both domestic and institutional spaces. He often insists that color should act as a mediator, not a distraction, and in this case the subdued tone allows the angles and geometry to speak most clearly. The upholstery, with its slight texture, provides tactile interest without overwhelming the form, ensuring that the chair maintains its dual nature as both functional object and conceptual statement.</p>
            <p>In development, Hartmann worked between parametric modeling and hand-built prototypes, a process that defines much of his practice. Early iterations were carved from blocks of dense foam to test comfort, the designer sitting in them for hours to evaluate minute changes in angle and posture. These experiments were then translated into digital models, where algorithms refined the geometry into precise facets. The process was iterative and slow, moving back and forth between digital accuracy and human intuition. Hartmann has explained that the body often resists what the computer suggests, and that reconciliation between the two worlds is where the design truly comes alive. In the Shard Chair, that reconciliation is visible in every joint and surface, where the rigid logic of software meets the unpredictable needs of the human form.</p>

            <p>The Shard Chair is not a chair for every room, nor does it pretend to be. It is unapologetically specific, a piece that demands to be noticed and considered. In domestic interiors, it works as a focal point, altering the atmosphere of a space with its angular insistence. In galleries or public spaces, it reads as an artifact of design thinking, bridging art and utility. Hartmann has succeeded in producing a design that balances the immediacy of function with the depth of provocation, a reminder that the simplest objects are often the most loaded with meaning. The Shard Chair demonstrates that a chair does not merely support the body; it has the power to shape how we read the room itself, and by extension, how we understand the act of sitting.</p>
