          <p> Welcome to Pressed, where golden mornings meet golden waffles. Inspired by surf culture and the laid-back energy of the coast, we’re all about simple, high-quality ingredients pressed to perfection. Whether you're fueling up for dawn patrol or just chasing a slow morning, our menu is stacked with fresh flavors, strong coffee, and the kind of breakfast that keeps you coming back. </p>
          <p> At Pressed, we believe food should feel as good as it tastes. That’s why we keep things local, fresh, and made-to-order—crispy waffles, bold brews, and a lineup of sweet and savory creations designed to hit the spot. No frills, no shortcuts—just honest eats served with a side of good vibes. </p>
          <p> But it’s not just about the food—it’s about the experience. The smell of espresso in the air, the sound of a board sliding into the back of a truck, the post-surf warmth of a sunlit seat. We built Pressed to be more than a restaurant—it’s a gathering place for early risers, weekend cruisers, and anyone who knows that the best mornings start with great company and even better breakfast. </p>
          <p>So pull up, grab a seat, and take it slow. Whether you're here for a quick bite or a long conversation, we’re stoked to serve up something that fuels the day ahead. Pressed—where waffles, waves, and good mornings come together.</p>
